# Audio Wave 
## a web-based Audio Visualizer 
Audio Wave is a web development project. The main goal is to visualize the frequency data incoming audio (soundtracks). To achieve this goal, I used the soundCloud API to get the streamable audio url, Web Audio API to decode the frequency data, and D3.js to visualize. 
The project is currently hosted on: .
